## Overview

This repository contains open hardware design files for an experimental development board for Quectel [SA800-U](https://www.quectel.com/product/sa800u-wf-smart-module) System on Module (SoM) featuring Qualcomm [Snapdragon 845 Mobile Platform](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/application/smartphones/snapdragon-8-series-mobile-platforms/snapdragon-845-mobile-platform).
This development board break-routes the relevant I/O interfaces from the SoM keeping a small mechanical outline. 
The design files were prepared in KiCad.

## Repository structure

The main repository directory contains KiCad PCB project files, a LICENSE and README.
The remaining files are stored in the following directories:

* `lib` - contains the component libraries
* `img` - contains graphics for this README

## Key Features
